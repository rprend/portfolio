        <h1>How I write a book review</h1>
        <p>
          I publish book reviews. They are not like the kind you&#39;ll see in
          newspapers, so I thought I&#39;d explain how I write them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no desire to achieve completeness. The proper format for book
          review is: summarize the plot, and analyze the book&#39;s themes. I
          don&#39;t believe in thematic analysis, so i will not even try that.
          Nor will I guarantee or attempt to summarize the book to any
          reasonable metric of completeness. The way i write book reviews is
          this: after i finish the book, i list all of the things which stuck in
          my memory. I remember when character Y said this, i remember the
          sidenote on germ theory. I try to recall these memories as accurately
          as possible. Tidy up the list into paragraphs, then publish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I read books is because sometimes I read something which, against my
          intentions, sticks with me. These ideas keep me company on walks or
          mull with me in the shower. My reviews aren&#39;t reviews as much as
          they are lists of memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not writing a corpus survey. I have not read all the books of a
          type and ranked them. Nor will I try to classify genres. Nor any kind
          of classification at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          My book reviews are lists of memories. That&#39;s all. If I&#39;m
          lucky, you&#39;ll remember them, too.
