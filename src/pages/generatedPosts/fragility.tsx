        <h1>Bad moods as a fragility test</h1>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s say you want to read more, to go to the gym, to study
          scientific papers in your free time, to make music. There&#39;s a
          style of advice that many people give. It&#39;s especially pronounced
          with hustlers and hustle culture. The advice goes something like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Just wake up at 4 AM. Just force yourself to go to the gym. Just
            write a song. Just make yourself do extra math homework.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This technique fails on most people, because it is too hard. Musicians
          don&#39;t start randomly one day and write a song. They iterate over
          years-- starting with lessons their parents force them into, and then
          they perform oversimplified covers of easy rock songs, and then noodle
          on their guitar, and etc. The Beatles showed up to perform covers
          thousands of times before writing their famous works.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Iterate on an oversimplified version of the thing&quot; is
          strong advice for how to improve at something. Playing covers is the
          simpler version of writing your own songs. Learning a language is
          hard, &quot;listen and repeat a 30 minute Pimsleur recording every day
          on your walk home from work&quot; is specific. You can force yourself
          through it when you are tired or hungover or just don&#39;t feel like
          it.
        </p>

          Paul Graham <a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">wrote</a>{' '}
          about small lies you tell yourself to get over the small cognitive
          hump of starting to work each day. He lies to himself by saying
          &quot;we&#39;ll just read an abstract for a couple minutes&quot;, and
          invariably he gets invested and reads the whole a 30 page document.
          Had he been upfront to himself about his intentions, he wouldn&#39;t
          have started.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simplified process is simple enough you can force yourself to do it
          in a bad mood. The complexity of your oversimplification increases
          with skill level. Really, the complexity of your oversimplification{' '}
          <em>defines</em> your skill level. For a professional jazz guitarist,
          &quot;noodling&quot; means playing the notes from a specific scale in
          a specific voicing off the cuff; for an amateur, noodling means
          playing an open C chord followed by an open G and an open D.
        </p>
        <p>
          People become experts by raising the baseline of their
          oversimplifications, NOT by forcing themselves to do the complicated
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bad moods act as a simplicity test. If it gets thrown away in a bad
          mood, if it is impossible in a bad mood, then it is too complicated.
          It is beyond my skill level.
