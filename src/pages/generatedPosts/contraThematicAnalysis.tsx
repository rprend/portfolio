          Contra Thematic Analysis, or: How i learned to stop worrying and
          memorize facts
        </h1>
        <p>
          Growing up, my literature curricula obsessed with analyzing deeper
          meanings. Each analysis took the form of transliterations of embodied
          truths. &quot;Transliteration&quot; because the truths themselves live
          in a different meaning-space: they exist as nonverbal embodied wisdom.
          When you transliterate deeper meanings to English you produce cliches
          like &quot;sometimes it&#39;s the people you trusted most who betray
          you&quot;, or &quot;true love will stop at nothing&quot; or &quot;the
          arrogantly rich who sneers at his inferiors, is insecure next to the
          truly rich, who doesn&#39;t care about flashy status symbols&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transliterations are not translations, because they are incomplete.
          This is not controversial. Nobody upon reading Jane Austen claims to
          fully understand the experience of Georgian Era British aristocrats.
          And yet, in English class all through high school, we talked almost
          exclusively about these lossy transliterations. The shape of it was
          questions like : &quot;What do you think it represents that Jane
          Austen had the character rebuke this other one?&quot; and the correct
          answer being something like &quot;this was reflective of the social
          status of the time period between the lesser gentry and the more
          established nobles&quot;.
        </p>

          Represents. Analyze. Themes. These are the hallmarks of thematic
          analysis. They are useless.
        </p>
        <h2>Memory</h2>
        <p>
          Thematic analysis is useless by one key metric: memorability. I
          remember zero of the thematic analysis I did in high school. What I
          remember from my literature curriculum were the bits unrelated to
          deeper meaning. Producing a movie recreating scenes from Julius
          Caesar. Memorizing Hamlet soliloquies. Reading the End of Something
          out loud and hitting the line &quot;It isn&#39;t fun anymore&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memory filters the embodied from the disembodied. What you remember
          years later is what stuck with you enough to survive years of mental
          erosion. Thematic analysis is too complicated for high schoolers,
          because it doesn&#39;t stick. Students will pattern match how to
          respond in discussions with templates: &quot;Going off that, I think
          that the windiness of the weather in the scene represents the
          characters changing personality with the seasons...&quot;.

          Stop it! You are teaching how to break the rules before you teach the
          rules! You are teaching freeform before you teach the constrained.
          Miles Davis went to Juliard after all, he was no Kerouac blabbering
          nonsense high in the night. Something must be certain to be embodied.
          You cannot transmit embodied truths in English, by talking about them.
          You have to embody the story first, with simple things- recreate
          scenes, memorization, recitation. Just like music: you don&#39;t learn
          music by talking about it. You mimic other people&#39;s songs. You
          memorize them. You play them over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don&#39;t elevate music critics above the music they critique. Why
          then, do we elevate literary analysis?
