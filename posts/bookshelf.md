# Bookshelf

I have benefited from [others'](https://www.nickbeckstead.com/audiobooks) [publicly](https://subcriticalappraisal.com/bookshelf/) [posted](https://simonsarris.com/bookshelf) [booklists](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011), so I'd like to make one of my own. Here is a list of books, fiction or nonfiction, which I strongly recommend.

1. The New York Trilogy, Paul Auster.
2. Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino.
3. East of Eden, John Steinbeck.
4. Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman by Richard Feynman.
5. The Power Broker by Robert Caro.
